## How we used Intel One API

- For model training and collaborative workspace
- Utilize oneAPI's AI Analytics Toolkit, which includes optimized versions of popular machine learning and deep learning frameworks.
- All the models are trained in the jupyterhub workspace, <a href="https://jupyter.oneapi.devcloud.intel.com/user/u206691/doc/tree/edumate-intel_one_api.jupyterlab-workspace" > See the workspace here</a>
